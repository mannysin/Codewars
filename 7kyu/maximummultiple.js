/*
Problem:
Task
Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

Conditions :
N is divisible by divisor

N is less than or equal to bound

N is greater than 0.

Notes
The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positve values .
It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
Input >> Output Examples
1- maxMultiple (2,7) ==> return (6)
Explanation:
(6) is divisible by (2) , (6) is less than or equal to bound (7) , and (6) is > 0 .

2- maxMultiple (10,50)  ==> return (50)
Explanation:
(50) is divisible by (10) , (50) is less than or equal to bound (50) , and (50) is > 0 .*

3- maxMultiple (37,200) ==> return (185)
Explanation:
(185) is divisible by (37) , (185) is less than or equal to bound (200) , and (185) is > 0 .

My approach:

*/

function maxMultiple(divisor, bound){
    //your code here
}

/* Test Cases
describe("Basic tests", function(){
  Test.assertEquals(maxMultiple(2,7),6);
