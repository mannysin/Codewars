/*
Problem:
Write a function called whatday() which returns the day according to the number

1 returns 'Sunday'

2 returns 'Monday'

3 returns 'Tuesday'

4 returns 'Wednesday'

5 returns 'Thursday'

6 returns 'Friday'

7 returns 'Saturday'

if it's not a number between 1-7 return "Wrong, please enter a number between 1 and 7"

My approach:

*/

function whatday(num) { 
    // put your code here
}


/* Test Cases
describe( "whatday", function(){
  it( "should work for the examples" , function(){
    Test.assertEquals(whatday(1),'Sunday')
    Test.assertEquals(whatday(2), 'Monday')
    Test.assertEquals(whatday(3),'Tuesday')
       Test.assertEquals(whatday(8),  'Wrong, please enter a number between 1 and 7')
    Test.assertEquals(whatday(20),  'Wrong, please enter a number between 1 and 7')

      });
});
*/

whatday(4) //outputs:
